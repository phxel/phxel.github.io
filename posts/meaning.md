# Meaning, Existence, and the Human Mind

## Introduction

We live in an age dominated by scientific progress and rational inquiry, where the mechanisms of the universe are continuously uncovered and explained. Yet, despite these advancements, questions of ultimate meaning remain unanswered. Can science truly explain *why* the universe exists, or is it limited to describing *how* it functions? My philosophy addresses this gap by proposing that meaning, existence, and the subject are intertwined in ways that science alone cannot account for.

In this post, I’ll outline my approach to understanding the meaning of life, the relationship between existence and the observer, and the boundaries of human perception. This perspective holds that meaning is not inherent in the world but is born out of necessity. It places the subject before existence, suggesting that without a conscious observer, existence itself would lack significance. From this foundation, we’ll explore how these ideas intersect with other philosophical questions, from the limits of language to the nature of time and morality.

## Meaning as a Product of Necessity

When asking, "What is the meaning of life?" people often assume that meaning is an objective quality—something waiting to be discovered, universally valid and consistent. But what if meaning is not a property of the universe at all? In my view, *meaning is born out of necessity*. 

In the early days of humanity, meaning was simple and concrete: survival. Food, water, shelter, and safety were the primary concerns, creating a framework of meaning directly tied to basic needs. As humans developed art, language, and culture, meaning evolved, expanding into new dimensions. Family, love, purpose, and self-expression became additional "necessities," defining a more complex meaning of life.

Take, for example, the way we derive meaning from relationships. While love or friendship isn’t a literal survival need, these bonds fulfill deep psychological necessities. Relationships give structure and significance to our lives, but they only hold meaning because we, as subjects, experience the need for companionship and connection. In this sense, meaning is a human creation, continuously constructed out of our needs and desires.

This approach also repositions *Maslow's hierarchy of needs*: *life itself* should be seen as the ultimate necessity at the base of the pyramid. Without life, there is no basis for fulfilling any needs, whether physical or psychological. This foundational layer supports all other needs, creating a system where meaning is generated through the lived experience of necessity.

## The Subject Before Existence

In traditional thought, existence (life) is taken as a given, a backdrop against which the drama of life unfolds. My approach, however, places the *subject*—the conscious observer—*before existence*. Without a subject to perceive, interpret, and give meaning, existence itself would be devoid of significance. There would be no experience, no interpretation, and no consciousness to render existence meaningful.

Consider this: if existence were a vast, silent canvas with no observers, what would be the point of its colors or shapes? It is the conscious subject that gives form, value, and meaning to existence. The universe could be filled with objects, laws, and structures, but without an observer, these elements would be like unread pages in a book—filled with content but devoid of significance.

In my perspective, *existence (life) functions as a pair of binoculars through which the subject perceives the world*. The binoculars enable the observer to see and interpret, but without them, there would be no perception, no "image," and ultimately, no meaning. This places the observer at the core of all experience, making the subject a prerequisite for any kind of meaningful existence. Without the observer, existence would be an unobserved, uninterpreted vastness.

## The Boundaries of Scientific Realism

Science is our most powerful tool for understanding *how* the universe works, but can it ever uncover *why* the universe exists? I argue that scientific realism, with all its achievements, cannot answer the question of ultimate purpose. While science describes the mechanisms, interactions, and structures of reality, these descriptions are limited to the observable and the measurable. *The "how" is simply a descriptor of the "why,"* like a photograph that captures an image but not the full landscape of reality.

For example, consider gravity. Science can explain how gravity functions, how it shapes the orbits of planets, and even how it warps space-time. But these descriptions do not reveal why gravity exists in the first place. Why does matter have mass, and why does mass create gravitational fields? These questions reach beyond the scientific framework, touching on the nature of existence itself—a realm science may never fully penetrate.

This view aligns with the idea that *scientific realism is inherently limited*. While it illuminates the mechanisms of reality, it cannot explain the ultimate cause or purpose behind them. The philosophical "why" lies beyond the reach of empirical observation, residing in the realm of metaphysics and, possibly, beyond human understanding.

## The Limits of Perception: Existence as Binoculars

When discussing metaphysics, it is crucial to consider the limits of human perception. Our capacity to understand the universe is restricted by what we can perceive, and our perception is bounded by existence itself—the "binoculars" through which we view reality. Anything outside the image seen through these binoculars remains fundamentally inaccessible.

Imagine a world beyond our field of vision, existing outside our binoculars. While we may sense that something is out there—some ultimate truth or higher reality—our capacity to perceive it is restricted by the framework of existence. This idea resonates with Wittgenstein’s observation that *language cannot fully encapsulate the totality of reality*. Just as language imposes limits on what can be expressed, perception imposes limits on what can be experienced and understood.

For instance, consider concepts like infinity or eternity. While we can theorize about them, they lie beyond our direct experience. We are bound by finite lives and linear time, making such ideas ultimately abstract. Even our ability to conceptualize infinity is filtered through the "binoculars" of existence, which can only show us a limited version of reality.

## The Void: We Call Out to It, Not the Other Way Around

In this philosophy, it’s essential to recognize that *the void does not call out to us; we call out to the void*. We project our needs, desires, and questions onto the unknown, attempting to fill it with meaning, yet it remains silent, indifferent. The void does not beckon us to seek answers; we, driven by our own existential curiosity, call out in search of purpose.

Take the classic question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?" The very act of asking this question implies that something exists. To even contemplate nothingness, we must already be conscious, already engaged with existence. Our questions reveal more about us—the subjects—than they do about the void itself.

This realization highlights the asymmetry between humanity and the unknown. Our curiosity, imagination, and fear of the unknown drive us to seek answers, but the void offers none. It is passive, and any answers we derive from it are reflections of our own desires and projections.

## Timelessness: Living in the Present as a Form of Infinity

In redefining timelessness as living in the present, I argue that those who are fully immersed in the *here and now* touch upon a kind of infinity. The present moment is the only reality we can directly experience; the past is a memory, and the future a projection. By fully engaging with the present, we connect with something timeless within the fleeting nature of life.

Consider the flow state—a psychological state in which a person becomes so absorbed in an activity that they lose awareness of time. In these moments, time appears to dissolve, and the individual experiences a sense of unity and completeness. This experience suggests that true "timelessness" is not about escaping time but about embracing each moment as a self-contained infinity.

This perspective has implications for how we view life and death. Rather than seeing life as a sequence of past, present, and future, this philosophy suggests viewing it as a series of present moments. In this way, each day lived is wonderful, even if not every day is wonderful. The value of life lies in its presentness, and the awareness of our finite nature gives these moments depth and meaning.

## Morality and Meaning: Shaped by the Subject

This philosophy also impacts our understanding of morality. If meaning is something we bring into existence through necessity, then moral values, too, are products of subjective experience. Moral systems are frameworks constructed by societies to address the necessities of human coexistence, safety, and well-being. They are not absolute properties of the universe but are created and sustained by conscious subjects.

For instance, concepts like justice, fairness, and compassion are based on human experiences of empathy and cooperation. They hold value because they address human needs. In a world without conscious beings, such concepts would have no relevance or existence. This approach aligns with moral subjectivism, which holds that moral values are contingent upon human perceptions and experiences rather than objective truths.

However, this doesn’t reduce morality to pure relativism. Instead, it suggests that moral values gain their significance from the collective needs of conscious beings. While moral principles may vary between cultures, they are grounded in the shared experience of being human, rooted in our shared necessities.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Mystery

Ultimately, my philosophy is one of acceptance—an acknowledgment that the search for ultimate answers may be futile, and that the absence of definitive answers is itself an answer. *Existence and meaning gain their significance through the subject.* Without a conscious observer, there would be no image, no binoculars, no interpretation, and no meaning.

This perspective does not diminish the importance of the unknown; rather, it invites us to embrace the mystery of existence. We may call out to the void, but it remains

 silent, leaving us to find our own answers in the act of living.

By recognizing the limitations of our perception and the boundaries of scientific realism, we allow ourselves to experience life in all its richness. Meaning is not something we uncover; it is something we create, continually woven from the threads of our needs, desires, and experiences. In this sense, the purpose of life is not to solve the mystery, but to live it—to find meaning in each moment, however fleeting, and to embrace the wonder of a world we can only partially understand.

This approach to life is one that values the journey over the destination, the questions over the answers, and the presence over the pursuit of timelessness. It’s a philosophy for those willing to accept the unknown, find meaning in the lived experience, and recognize that *we are the creators of the meaning we seek*.
